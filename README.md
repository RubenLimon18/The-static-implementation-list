# Song List Implementation in C++ with Song Objects

This project is an implementation of songs list in C++, where each song is represented as an object of the Song class. 



## Key Features
- Insertion, Deletion and Retrieve: Songs are inserted, deleted and retrieved after a specified position, allowing precise control over each song's location in the list.
- Add first song: To add the first song in the list, a position of -1 must be provided, to ensure that the song is added at the beginning of the list.

  ./main.exe
```
